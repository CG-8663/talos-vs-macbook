# talos-vs-macbook-vs-GX10

> Chronara fork of [AlexCheema/talos-vs-macbook](https://github.com/AlexCheema/talos-vs-macbook), extended with NVIDIA DGX Spark (GB10: Grace + Blackwell), M3 Ultra, and M1 Max columns. Upstream PR open at [AlexCheema#2](https://github.com/AlexCheema/talos-vs-macbook/pull/2).

A single Grace ARM core (Cortex-X925 @ 3.9 GHz boost) on an [NVIDIA DGX Spark](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/products/workstations/dgx-spark/) hits **4,364,405 tok/sec** running Karpathy's [microGPT](https://gist.github.com/karpathy/8627fe009c40f57531cb18360106ce95) — a 4,192-parameter character-level transformer — through a hand-rolled C+NEON forward pass. **That's 16% faster than M4 Max** ([Alex Cheema's original benchmark](https://github.com/AlexCheema/talos-vs-macbook): 3,756,165 tok/sec) on the *same source file*. ARMv9's wider NEON pipes beat Apple silicon's higher clock at this scale.

This fork runs Karpathy's microGPT in seven different ways across:

- **NVIDIA DGX Spark (GB10 superchip)** — 20-core Grace ARM CPU (Cortex-X925/A725) plus a Blackwell GPU, sharing 128 GB of unified memory. Runs the existing C path on Grace (no Apple-specific code needed) and two new CUDA paths on Blackwell.
- **M4 Max MacBook Pro** — Alex's anchor.
- **M3 Ultra Mac Studio** (Mac15,14, 20P+8E, 96 GB).
- **M1 Max Mac Studio** (Mac13,1).
- compared against [TALOS-V2](https://github.com/Luthiraa/TALOS-V2)'s 53,000 tok/sec hardware implementation on a Cyclone V FPGA — Alex's reference.

The model is so small (~17 KB at fp32) that it fits in L1 cache and the whole forward pass is ~4,000 multiply-accumulates per token. That makes the benchmark less about arithmetic and more about *overhead*. The interesting question turns out to be: which implementations even *beat* the FPGA?

A single Grace core (Cortex-X925 at 3.9 GHz boost) in well-tuned C does **~82×** the FPGA's throughput, beating M4 Max's hand-rolled NEON path by 16% on the same source. Apple silicon's c+NEON path holds the next three slots across three chip generations (~71× M4 Max, ~69× M3 Ultra, ~55× M1 Max). NumPy and MLX still come in *under* the FPGA on every CPU we tried — their per-call dispatch overhead is bigger than the actual work. MLX-on-GPU is the worst — kernel launch overhead annihilates a 4K-MAC forward pass. lol.

Blackwell GB10 sits in the middle. Naïve CUDA (one launch per matmul / RMSNorm / softmax / sample) lands at ~19k tok/sec — *under* the FPGA, same launch-overhead pattern as MLX-on-GPU but on a different launch surface. A fused persistent CUDA kernel that pins all 4,192 fp32 weights in shared memory and runs the entire timed window in one launch hits **~414k tok/sec — 7.8× the FPGA, but still ~10× slower than every C core in the table**. Single-stream char-by-char inference at this scale just isn't where GPUs live. (See *why is Blackwell slower than Grace?* for the cycle-counting walk-through.)

![throughput](charts/throughput.png)

And on perf-per-watt — assuming ~3 W per Grace core (estimated, not measured directly), ~5 W per active Apple P-core (Apple's published per-core figures), 19.96 W for Blackwell during the persistent kernel run (measured via `nvidia-smi --query-gpu=power.draw -lms 100`, n=257), and ~2 W for the Cyclone V fabric — Grace c+NEON wins outright at ~1.45M tok/sec/W. Apple's C+NEON paths come next at ~700–750k tok/sec/W. The FPGA at 26.5k still beats Blackwell's 20.7k on watts; the FPGA's 2 W floor wins efficiency even when CUDA wins absolute throughput. Python and MLX paths are wasted power either way.

## a note on Apple silicon scaling

c+NEON tracks clock and microarch generation roughly linearly across the three Apple chips: M4 Max 3.76M (~4.4 GHz) > M3 Ultra 3.63M (~4.05 GHz) > M1 Max 2.91M (~3.2 GHz Firestorm). M1 Max's Q4.12 path is ~30% behind its own fp32, vs ~17% on M4 Max — Apple's `int16` widening MAC pipeline got noticeably wider between 2021 and 2024. None of these cores does anything the others don't; same forward pass, same ~4,000 MACs, same L1 fit.

## try it yourself

On any Apple Silicon Mac:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AlexCheema/talos-vs-macbook && cd talos-vs-macbook && ./run.sh
```

That's it. The script fetches microGPT's trained weights from upstream, builds the C versions with `clang -O3 -march=native -ffast-math`, and runs all six implementations back-to-back. Takes about 90 seconds total. You only need `python3`, `numpy`, `make`, and `clang` (all already on a stock Mac); MLX is optional (`pip install mlx` if you want those rows).

On NVIDIA DGX Spark / GB10:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AlexCheema/talos-vs-macbook && cd talos-vs-macbook && ./run_gx10.sh
```

Builds the same Python + C benchmarks plus both CUDA paths. Needs `nvcc` (CUDA 13, `-arch=sm_121` for Blackwell GB10), `gcc 13+`, glibc with `libmvec`, and `python3 + numpy`. The Makefile is gated on `nvcc` being present, so the existing Apple Silicon path is unchanged.

## what's in here

Each implementation is a single self-contained file. No frameworks pulled in past what's strictly needed.

| file | what | lines |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `pure_python.py` | Karpathy's reference forward pass, dependency-free Python. The slow baseline. | 130 |
| `bench_numpy.py` | NumPy fp32, BLAS pinned to 1 thread, KV cache. | 138 |
| `bench_mlx.py` | Same forward pass in [MLX](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx), Apple's M-series-tuned framework. CPU and GPU. | 122 |
| `bench_c.c` | Hand-written C with NEON intrinsics. fp32. The ceiling. | 268 |
| `bench_c_q412.c` | Same, but with Q4.12 fixed-point matmuls — the exact arithmetic TALOS uses. | 270 |
| `bench_cuda.cu` | Naïve launch-per-op CUDA, fp32. The "use the GPU like an accelerator" path. | 290 |
| `bench_cuda_persistent.cu` | Single persistent CUDA kernel; weights pinned in shared mem, full forward pass + sampler stays on-device. | 270 |
| `model.py` | Shared loader + sampler. | 66 |

About 1,600 lines across all seven implementations. Same model, same weights, same multinomial sampling, same temperature 0.5, same single-thread batch=1 char-by-char autoregressive setup.

## sample output

Each implementation generates the same kinds of name-like strings. The Python ones (sharing Python's `random.choices`) produce identical output:

```
sample  1: kana
sample  2: keelan
sample  3: alilan
sample  4: ariel
sample  5: cairi
sample  6: mayan
sample  7: kenia
sample  8: akalen
sample  9: danyli
sample 10: man
```

Run `python3 pure_python.py --names` (or `bench_numpy.py --names`, `bench_mlx.py --names`, `./bench_c --names`, `./bench_c_q412 --names`, `./bench_cuda --names`, `./bench_cuda_persistent --names`) to see your own. The CUDA paths use the same xorshift32 sampler as the C versions; both `bench_cuda --names` and `bench_cuda_persistent --names` produce byte-identical output to each other, confirming the fused persistent kernel matches the launch-per-op baseline.

## why is NumPy slower than the FPGA?

The model is genuinely tiny. One forward pass is roughly:

- 3 RMSNorms: ~100 FLOPs
- 4 matmuls of shape (16,16)·(16,): 4 × 256 = 1,024 FMAs
- attention with up to 16 keys: ~256 FMAs
- 1 matmul (64,16)·(16,) + 1 matmul (16,64)·(64,): 2,048 FMAs
- 1 lm_head matmul (27,16)·(16,): 432 FMAs

Round it to ~4,000 multiply-accumulates per token. At single-thread M4 Max MacBook Pro NEON throughput (~16 GFLOPS in scalar fp32, much more with FMA pipelines), the *arithmetic* takes well under a microsecond. So if you can dispatch the work in <1 µs you'll fly; otherwise you don't.

NumPy's per-call overhead (Python ↔ C boundary, dtype dispatch, broadcast checks) is in the few-microseconds range. With ~25 ops per token × ~1 µs each, you're already at 25 µs/token = 40k tok/sec — which is exactly what we measure. The numbers aren't a NumPy weakness; they're a model-too-small situation.

MLX-on-GPU is even worse because Metal kernel launches are tens of microseconds each. Apple silicon is brilliant; it's just not the right tool for a 4,000-MAC workload. This is why people batch.

The same logic reproduces on Grace and Blackwell. NumPy fp32 on Grace lands at 41,032 tok/sec — *also* under the FPGA — despite the underlying BLAS being completely different from Apple's (OpenBLAS on aarch64 Linux vs Accelerate). The bottleneck isn't BLAS, it's the Python ↔ C boundary, so the number is roughly platform-flat across all three Apple chips and Grace. And `bench_cuda` (naïve launch-per-op CUDA) lands at 19,127 tok/sec on Blackwell — same death-by-launch-overhead pattern, just on a different launch surface. Kernel launches on Blackwell are *cheaper* than Metal's (naïve CUDA beats M4 Max MLX-on-GPU 6×) but with ~25 launches plus a host↔device token-id round-trip per token, you're at ~50 µs/token = ~19k tok/sec. Same disease, different syringe.

The FPGA wins on *absolute* power draw — a Cyclone V on the DE1-SoC pulls maybe 2 W; one M4 Max MacBook Pro P-core under this load is more like 5 W — but with ~71× the throughput at ~2.5× the power, the MacBook wins on perf-per-watt by roughly an order of magnitude (~28×) too. The FPGA's real advantages are form factor and deterministic latency: you can run TALOS off a battery on something credit-card sized, you can't run a MacBook there. To match TALOS in C we use about 1.4% of one core's time.

## how the C version works

`bench_c.c` is the interesting one. The trick is that the model is small enough that everything — weights (16 KB), KV cache (2 KB), all activations — fits in L1 D-cache. So the bottleneck is purely instruction throughput.

Each matmul is hand-unrolled. The (R,16)·(16,) shape is perfect for NEON: load the 16-element input vector once into four `float32x4_t` registers, then for each output row compute 4 fused multiply-adds and a horizontal reduce. The (16,64)·(64,) MLP-out matmul fully unrolls the inner 64-element dot product. RMSNorm reduces with `vaddvq_f32`. Sampling is xorshift32 + cumulative scan.

The Q4.12 version is the same structure but with `int16_t` weights and `vmlal_s16` widening MACs into `int32_t` accumulators, shifted right by 12 between layers. RMSNorm and softmax stay in float (TALOS uses LUTs and Newton iterations for these in hardware). Quantization error vs fp32 is ~0.0001 per weight, and several generated names match between the fp32 and Q4.12 versions byte-for-byte.

The same `bench_c.c` and `bench_c_q412.c` build cleanly on Grace ARM (gcc 13.3, `-O3 -march=native -ffast-math`) — no Apple-specific intrinsics, the NEON path is portable Armv8/9. On Linux glibc the link line needs `-lm -lmvec` because gcc auto-vectorises the attention `expf` calls.

## how the persistent CUDA kernel works

`bench_cuda_persistent.cu` launches one block of 32 threads — a single warp — and runs the entire timed window in that one launch. On entry the warp co-loads all 4,192 fp32 weights into shared memory and zeros the KV cache. Then a per-token loop runs the full forward pass without leaving the kernel:

- RMSNorm uses warp-shuffle reductions (`__shfl_xor_sync`) — no shared-memory scratch.
- Each (R, EMBD) matvec is one thread per output row — 16 lanes for the 16-wide outputs, all 32 active when R=64 (each thread handles two MLP rows).
- Attention runs one thread per head: 4 lanes do the dot-product / softmax / weighted-sum independently across the 4 heads.
- Sampling is xorshift32 + cumulative scan on lane 0, broadcast back via `__shfl_sync`.

Crucially, the next iteration just continues the loop. No relaunch, no host roundtrip, no global memory traffic for activations between tokens. Only the KV cache writes touch shared memory across iterations. The only host involvement during timing is `cudaDeviceSynchronize()` at the very end.

This is the only path on the GPU that beats the FPGA. The naïve `bench_cuda.cu` (one launch per matmul / RMSNorm / softmax / sample, with the token id round-tripping host↔device every step) loses 22× to the persistent version — almost all of that gap is launch overhead, not arithmetic.

## why is Blackwell slower than Grace?

A single Grace core in C+NEON does 4.36M tok/sec. The persistent CUDA kernel — same forward pass, no relaunches, weights pinned in shared memory — does 413K tok/sec on Blackwell. **A 10.5× gap on identical work.** The model still fits in cache on both sides, so it's not memory bandwidth. Where does the gap go?

Two factors stack.

**Clock.** Grace's Cortex-X925 boosts to ~3.9 GHz; a Blackwell SM in GB10 clocks at ~1.5–2 GHz. Roughly 2× behind on raw clock before anything else.

**Active SIMT lanes.** A single warp does 1 instruction per warp-clock across 32 lanes. On this model that's only 16 lanes during the (R, EMBD) matvecs, 4 during attention (one per head), and 1 during the sampler. Effective lane utilisation across the forward pass is roughly 50%. Useful ops per warp-clock end up similar to what one Grace core issues per cycle through its wide out-of-order + 4-lane NEON FMA pipes — but the GPU is taking ~2× the wall-time per warp-clock because of clock.

2× clock × 2× IPC + a small per-op `__syncwarp` overhead across ~25 sequential ops ≈ 10×. Matches the measured ratio. The persistent kernel isn't doing anything wrong — single-stream char-by-char inference at this scale just isn't where GPUs live. *Multiple* persistent kernels — one block per SM, ~80 SMs on GB10 — would scale linearly: >30M tok/sec batched throughput on the same hardware. Different question, different answer.

## todos

- multi-thread version with 12 independent sampling streams (would scale to ~45M tok/sec, probably)
- multi-stream persistent CUDA: N independent streams, N blocks. With ~80 SMs on GB10 and 413k tok/sec/stream that's potentially >30M tok/sec batched throughput.
- multi-thread C on Grace's 10 X925 cores — extrapolating from 4.36M/core, ~40M tok/sec.
- a Metal compute shader version (just to confirm the GPU launch-overhead theory directly on Apple silicon)
- batched throughput numbers (where MLX would actually shine)
- direct power measurement on Apple silicon and Grace, to retire the ~5 W and ~3 W per-core estimates
